# Fuel Gauge
"""
Fuel gauges indicate, often with fractions, just how much fuel is in a tank. For instance
1/4 indicates that a tank is 25% full,
1/2 indicates that a tank is 50% full, and
3/4 indicates that a tank is 75% full.
"""
# Requirement
"""
In a file called fuel.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a fraction,
formatted as X/Y, wherein each of X and Y is an integer, and then outputs,
as a percentage rounded to the nearest integer, how much fuel is in the tank.
If, though, 1% or less remains,
output E instead to indicate that the tank is essentially empty.
And if 99% or more remains,
output F instead to indicate that the tank is essentially full.

If, though,
X or Y is not an integer,
X is greater than Y, or
Y is 0, instead prompt the user again.
(It is not necessary for Y to be 4.) Be sure to catch any exceptions like
ValueError or
ZeroDivisionError.
